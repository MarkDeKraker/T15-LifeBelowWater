## Key Features

* Information pages about climate issues affecting the ocean
  - Each page is divided into the smaller, more digestible sub-topics, so it's easy to make a couple different lessons about a certain topic. For the current version, we address the topic of plastic pollution.
* Made with a young audience in mind
  - The content of the information pages is worded in a way that someone around the age of 10 to 12 could understand.
* Make and host quizzes
  - With a fully functional quizbuilder, you can easily make, edit, delete quizzes and individual quiz questions. You can enter a quiz code on the home page to fill out the quiz.
* Easily come up with quiz questions with the help of A.I.
  - Just select a topic and click the generate button to quickly generate a corresponding question
* A login system
  - There's no need for an account if you just want your students to fill a quiz in, but you do need an account to make the quizzes and see the information pages. That's why we have a functional registration and login system.
* Security
  - Your security and data privacy are important to us. Our system was designed with secure endpoints. We only collect your login information and it's safely encrypted.
